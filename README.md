# Heart Attack Predictor with AutoML
**Abstract:** Main Aim of this project is to predict whether a person is having a risk of heart attack or not, using Automated Machine Learning Techniques. We are given which various attributes are given which are crucial for heart Disease Detection. Using this data we build a model using AutoML Techiques.

What is AutoML?<br>
Automated machine learning (AutoML) is the process of automating the tasks of applying machine learning to real-world problems. <br> 
We will be using EvalML Library for this project
